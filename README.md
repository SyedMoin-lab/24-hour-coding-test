# React Flow [live demo](https://chatbot-flow-builder.vercel.app/)


This project is a simple React application built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and next.js . It demonstrates the implementation of drag and drop nodes with the ability to connect them. The state of the nodes and their connections can be saved and restored.

## Features

1. Drag and drop nodes.
2. Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node's edge to another.
3. Clicking on a node selects it, and its label can be modified from the sidebar.
4. Clicking anywhere on the pane deselects the selected node.
5. Save and restore functionality, which saves the current state of the nodes and their connections, and can restore the state later.
